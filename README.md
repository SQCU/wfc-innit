hopefully less picky than module-importing ES6 projects

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
1: open index in your favorite local environment
2: see if it works

# CONSIDERATIONS FOR DEV
i honestly forgot everything i ever learned about ES6, which is no big deal.
memory is a regenerative process, not like running your fingers over immutable grooves worn into the substance of your being.
whatever is burrs and edges stick out will no doubt be sanded down.

# GOALS AND SPECIFICATIONS
the goal for this project is set up a handy editor allowing ingress of image-data,
processing of image-data into macro-scale texture outputs, 
and ideally some kind of measured feedback so we can numerically compare the output behavior of WFC inputs.

WFC is supposed to be pretty content-agnostic.
ideally this means whatever algorithms work goes into this project can be reused elsewhere.
(node docker container exposed as API to mud server? barebones d8-only environment?)
